## Bio

Matt is an AI Specialist and Wizard (member of the innovation and excellence team) at Leading EDJE where he consults and teaches software engineering, AI, and data science concepts in the most ridiculous ways possible. Matt has used machine learning to settle debates over whether Die Hard is a Christmas movie, reinforcement learning to drive the behavior of digital squirrels, data analytics to suggest improvements to his favorite TV show, and AI agents to play board games and create an AI agent with the personality of a dog. Matt is the author of "Data Science in .NET with Polyglot Notebooks" and "Refactoring with C#" as well as several LinkedIn Learning courses. Matt helps organize the Central Ohio .NET Developer Group, runs several blogs and a YouTube channel, has a Masterâ€™s of Science in Data Analytics, and is a current Microsoft MVP in AI and .NET.

## Abstract

AI and machine learning projects can be powerful, transformative, and fraught with peril. In this session you'll hear stories of many different AI product prototypes ranging from the ridiculous such as a mirror built to tease the user to practical systems involving conversational AI agents that answer questions help plan your day to the business altering like automated document processing systems and code bugfix classification systems.

While many of the systems we'll discuss are beyond silly, we'll get to walk through the process of envisioning, designing, implementing, and evaluating artificial intelligence and machine learning systems as well as the practice of creating prototypes and identifying and resolving potential quality, performance, and ethical issues early in the process. Plus, the variety in topics discussed means this session will serve as a laugh-filled tour of what's possible with modern artificial intelligence and machine learning.
