# Adopting Serverless Architecture

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2024-10-05
- **Work Item:** 0001-Serverless_Adoption

## Context and Problem

As a tech startup, we need to build a scalable web application quickly to meet growing user demand. Traditional infrastructure solutions would require significant time and resources, which we cannot afford.

## Decision Drivers

- Need for rapid development and deployment to stay competitive
- Limited resources for managing infrastructure
- Unpredictable traffic patterns requiring automatic scaling
- Minimizing operational overhead to focus on core development

## Considered Options

- Serverless Architecture (Azure Functions)
- Traditional Server-Based Architecture
- Containerized Microservices

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Serverless Architecture (Azure Functions)," because it allowed the team to focus on writing code without worrying about infrastructure management, provided automatic scaling, and minimized operational overhead.

#### Consequences

- **Good, because:** Faster time-to-market, reduced operational costs, and improved scalability.
- **Bad, because:** Initial learning curve and dependency on third-party services, leading to some vendor lock-in concerns.

#### Implementation

- Set up Azure Functions for backend processing
- Integrate with other Azure services (API Management, Cosmos DB, etc.) as needed
- Monitor performance and make adjustments as required
- Train the team on serverless best practices and Azure tools

#### Confirmation

- Regular performance reviews and scaling checks
- Continuous monitoring of costs and operational overhead
- Feedback loops from the development team to ensure smooth operations

#### Stakeholders

- Development Team
- Operations Team
- Product Management
- Customers

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Serverless Architecture (Azure Functions)

- **Good, because:** Faster development, reduced costs, automatic scaling.
- **Bad, because:** Learning curve, dependency on Azure, potential vendor lock-in.

### Traditional Server-Based Architecture

- **Good, because:** Familiar to team, more control over infrastructure.
- **Bad, because:** Higher operational overhead, slower to scale, increased time-to-market.

### Containerized Microservices

- **Good, because:** Flexibility, isolation of services, easier scaling than traditional servers.
- **Bad, because:** More complex setup and management, still requires infrastructure oversight.
