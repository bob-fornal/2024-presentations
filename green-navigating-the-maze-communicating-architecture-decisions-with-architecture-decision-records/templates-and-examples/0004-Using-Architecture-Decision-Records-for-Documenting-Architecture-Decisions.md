- **Work Item:** [6319 - Developing an Architecture Decision Log](https://dev.azure.com)

---

## Context and Problem

Architectural decisions are made regularly in our development process, but there's often a lack of documentation or a centralized repository for these decisions. This leads to inefficiencies in knowledge sharing, onboarding new team members, and understanding the rationale behind past choices.

## Decision Drivers

- Lack of centralized knowledge repository for architectural decisions
- Need for efficient knowledge-sharing and onboarding processes

## Considered Options

- Manual documentation without a standardized format
- Using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for documenting architectural decisions
- Using a different documentation format or tool

## Decision Outcome

The chosen option is "Using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for documenting architectural decisions" because it provides a standardized format for documenting decisions, enabling better knowledge sharing and improving onboarding processes.

#### Consequences

- Good, because it provides a standardized format for documenting decisions, ensuring consistency and clarity.
- Good, because it improves knowledge sharing across the team, reducing duplication of effort and facilitating better communication.
- Bad, because it requires initial setup and adoption efforts to integrate ADRs into the development workflow.

#### Implementation

1. Introduce ADRs as part of the development process during architecture discussions.
2. Provide training and guidance on how to create and maintain ADRs.
3. Establish a centralized repository for storing ADRs that are accessible to all team members.
4. Integrate ADR creation and review into the regular development workflow.

#### Confirmation

To ensure compliance and effectiveness, the implementation of ADRs will be confirmed through regular reviews during architecture discussions and retrospectives.

#### Stakeholders

- Architecture Team
- Software Product Owners
- Software Support Manager
- IT Director

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Manual documentation without a standard format

- Good, because it allows flexibility in documentation style.
- Bad, because it lacks consistency and makes it difficult to find and understand decisions.

### Using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for documenting architectural decisions

- Good, because it provides a standardized format for documenting decisions, ensuring consistency and clarity.
- Good, because it improves knowledge sharing across the team, reducing duplication of effort and facilitating better communication.
- Bad, because it requires initial setup and adoption efforts to integrate ADRs into the development workflow.

### Using a different documentation format or tool

- Neutral, because it may offer some documentation capabilities but may not be tailored specifically for architectural decisions.
- Bad, because it may not provide the same level of consistency and clarity as ADRs.

## More Information

No more information is available.

## Follow-On Information

After acceptance, ADRs will be integrated into the development process. Regular reviews will ensure that ADRs are being created and maintained effectively. Any updates or revisions to the ADR format will be discussed and implemented as needed.
