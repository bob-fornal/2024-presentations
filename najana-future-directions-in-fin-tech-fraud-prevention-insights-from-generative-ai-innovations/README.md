## Abstract

Abstract:
As the FinTech sector expands, so does the sophistication of fraud schemes, necessitating advanced detection and prevention solutions. Our research explores the potential of generative AI innovations, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and synthetic data generation techniques, in shaping the future of FinTech fraud prevention. By leveraging these AI techniques, FinTech firms can enhance detection accuracy, reduce false positives, and anticipate emerging fraud tactics. We highlight key generative AI innovations, their practical applications in real-world FinTech environments, and future strategies for fraud prevention, emphasizing the critical role of generative AI in creating resilient and secure financial ecosystems for proactive fraud combat.

Introduction:
Generative AI innovations provides a forward-looking perspective on the future of fraud prevention in FinTech. Cover emerging trends, potential breakthroughs, and the evolving role of generative AI in creating secure financial systems.

Problem Statement:
As FinTech evolves, fraudsters develop more advanced schemes, posing significant challenges for detection and prevention. Traditional methods often struggle with high false positives and fail to anticipate new fraud tactics, resulting in financial losses and reduced customer trust.

Solution: Generative AI Innovations
Generative AI offers a transformative approach to fraud detection and prevention:
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs can generate realistic synthetic data that mimics real-world transactions. This data is used to train detection models, improving their ability to identify subtle and previously unseen fraudulent patterns.
Synthetic Data Generation: By creating diverse fraud scenarios, synthetic data helps in robust model training, enhancing the system's ability to recognize and respond to various types of fraud.
